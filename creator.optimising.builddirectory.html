		<div class="container">	<h1>Inspecting the Build Directory</h1>		<p>When editing your pages, you should be using full-size images with the minimum of compression applied. When you perform a build, FutureFolio Creator will resize your images to the size they are used on your pages, and, if they are JPEGs, compress them to the setting you have chosen. It will also generate retina-quality images for iPad 3 and other retina-compatible devices.</p>
	<p>When the build is finished, Creator will produce a zip file of your issue, and you'll be able to see how big your finished issue is. It will also produce a build directory, showing you all the files that went into the zip. If your issue size is unexpectedly large, the best place to start is to examine this build directory: sort all the files by size, and see which ones take up the most space.</p>
	<p>If you find you have several files taking up a large part of your issue, you will find it most effective to try to lower the sizes of these files first, before trying to optimise the smaller files.</p>
	
	<div class="caution">
		<h2>Keeping your directories separate</h2>
		
		<p>Your issue build directory and your issue working directory are kept separate on your file system, and you should never mix the two.</p>
		<p>The reason for this is because when you do a build, your images are scaled down and compressed, ready for use on the device. If you then use this built version of your issue for editing, you'll be recompressing compressed pictures, resulting in a drastic reducation of quality.</p>
		<p>Always, always ensure that you keep your issue working directory separate from your build directory.</p>
