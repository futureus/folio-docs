		<div class="container">	<h1>Building an issue</h1>		<p>Once you've completed your issue you'll need to export it out of FutureFolio Creator, this process is called building. When building, FutureFolio Creator will automatically take all used images, movies and media assets, scan your body copy and grab any files from there and finally check for any files referenced in your <strong>AdditionalBuildFiles</strong> file, copy them, compress, resize, create retina and non-retina versions of them and bundle them together as a single issue archive.</p>
	<p>A built archive can be placed in FutureFolio Viewer (see <a href="futurefolio.html"> "Viewing in FutureFolio Viewer"</a>) or submitted to your account manager to add the issue to your FutureFolio app.</p>
	<p>In this section you'll learn how to setup your issue for building and what the build process is actually doing.</p>
	<p>Here's a short breakdown of the subjects covered in this section:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Issue settings - Prepare your issue details for the final build.</li>
		<li>Issue version support - Understand how FutureFolio handles exported issue versions and corresponding app versioning.</li>
