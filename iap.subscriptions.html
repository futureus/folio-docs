		<div class="container">	<h1>Subscriptions</h1>		<p>Subscriptions follow the same pricing tiers as single issue sales (including free). See <a href="iap.pricing-tiers.html"> "Pricing Tiers"</a> for details on the pricing tiers. Subscriptions are by default auto-renewing, regardless of term. If a customer takes up a 30 day subscription, this amounts to a life-time commitment which will only terminate when they explicitly cancel. The number of days in the term is  the number of days between renewals, not the length of the subscription.</p>
	
	<p>Apple's subscription terms are all time-based, rather than issue-based. They are either 1-day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days or 365 days. A time-based subscription term can be a challenge to explain to the user, as a fixed time period can give a different number of issues depending on the start date. </p>
	
	<p>Note that App revenue is usually boosted by being featured on one of Apple's App Store lists, such as <em>Top Paid</em>, <em>Top Grossing</em> etc. This is worth bearing in mind when considering pricing structure. A subscription model that renews more frequently will bump up the revenue more frequently, and may sustain an app better by keeping it in the <em>Top Grossing</em> list.</p>
	
	<div class="caution">
		<h2>Changing the subscription price</h2>
		<p>Ensure that you <em>never</em> increase the cost of an existing subscription, as this will switch off the auto-renewals for those on this option.</p>
