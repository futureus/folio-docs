		<div class="container">	<h1>App screenshots</h1>		<p>Screenshots are a requirement for any and all apps on the iTunes App Store, they define your apps supported device list, so if you want your app to be universal (iPad and iPhone) you need to provide both iPad and iPhone screenshots. If either set of screenshots are missing then the app upload created by the App Development Team will fail.</p>
	
	<div class="caution">
		<h2>Screenshots will only upload if they are the correct size</h2>
		<p>Your screenshots will not upload if they are not the correct dimensions for the device you are uploading for. Please use actual screenshots to avoid this issue. Here is a breakdown of the device screenshot sizes:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>iPad - 768 X 1024 (Retina: 1536 X 2048)</li>
			<li>iPhone - 320 X 480 (Retina: 640 X 960)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>Your screenshots are the quickest and easiest way to show off and sell your app to potential customers. It's essential that you pick the most aesthetically pleasing app screens to promote your app. Any key features of your app ideally need to be showcased here.</p>
	<p>To take a screenshot it is recommended you run your app on a device and use the <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> button combo to take your screenshots. This will ensure the screenshots are the correct size.</p>
	
	<div class="sidebar">
	    <h2>Screenshots only not as you know them</h2>
	    <p>You may have seen on the app store that some apps use the screenshot images to promote their app without being pure screenshots, they may contain two or more screenshots within them with some nuggets of information. This can be utilised to express features that cannot be seen in a single screenshot alone. However this is down to Apple's discretion as to if they will let your faux screenshot through.</p>
