		<div class="container">	<h1>Playing video</h1>		<p>Displaying a video is incredibly simple in FutureFolio. Videos are also one of the few things you can stream online in a digital replica, therefore you can in effect reduce your issue's download size.</p>
	<p>To include a video in your downloaded issue rather than streaming, simply link it up and place the file inside your issue archive.</p>
	
	<p>While file sizes and compression can be somewhat disregarded in favour of online streaming of video content, there are still a small list of requirements that must be met in order to successfully display a video inside a FutureFolio issue. These are device requirements and suggested codecs and compression:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>FutureFolio only supports MP4, M4V and MOV format video files.</li>
		<li>Video files should be compressed in the H.264 video codec and AAC Audio codec. As to bit rates and/or quality amounts it is down to user discretion. Please bear in mind though that large files played from the device and not streamed increase the size of your issue.</li>
		<li>Resolutions need to be sensible as the larger the resolution the larger the file size.</li>
		<li>Frame Rate is down to preference, however it's suggested you use between 15 and 25 FPS.</li>
		<li>Use unique filenames as they all live in one location.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To get the video to play you need to add a link box with a link pointing to <strong>media://myvideo.mp4</strong>, obviously replacing <strong>myvideo.mp4</strong> with your video's filename.</p>
	<p>You can also stream the video by entering a URL but replacing HTTP with media: <strong>media://www.mywebsite.com/myvideos/myvideo.mp4</strong>, again replacing <strong>myvideo.mp4</strong> with your video's filename and the website address with your own (make sure that your video is uploaded also).</p>
	<p>Regarding streaming, please bear in mind that viewing your video takes up bandwidth from your website. If your app becomes popular you may have to buy additional bandwidth from your website hosting provider to continue to serve that video.</p>

		<p>FutureFolio does a small amount of sanity checking in the form of looking for the video file extension. If it does not see the MP4, M4V or MOV extension it will not display.</p>
