		<div class="container">	<h1>Issue settings</h1>		<p>Before you build you need to make sure that all your settings are in order. This is a two step task:</p>
	<p>First you need to make sure your issue's settings are complete and up to date. Inside the Issue editor, tap the settings cog button, this will open the Issue Settings window. Ensure your Title (brand name), issue number, code (can be anything, best is it's something like <strong>TAP001</strong>, but required) and date (written).</p>
	
	<p>Choose a reading mode for your issue - one of:
	<ul>
		<li>Magazine - The standard mode. Users swipe left and right to change page.</li>
		<li>Flipbook - Users swipe left and right to change page using a 3D page-turning effect.</li>
		<li>App - Swiping to change page is disabled. Your app must provide a method for the user to navigate.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
	
	<p>Choose an edge turn mode for your issue - one of:
	<ul>
		<li>Normal - If the user taps within 50 pixels of the left and right page-edges, a page turn will occur.</li>
		<li>Slim - If the user taps within 25 pixels of the left and right page-edges, a page turn will occur.</li>
		<li>None - Tapping near the edges of the page does nothing. The user must swipe to turn the page.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
	
	<p>Lastly, select which orientations and devices are supported by your issue.</p>

	<p>Secondly you'll want to ensure that your individual pages have unique names and descriptions in their settings windows. Once built the FutureFolio app's internal search will use these titles and descriptions to display results (if your chrome uses a TOC system, these details will be displayed there also).</p>
