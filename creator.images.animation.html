		<div class="container">	<h1>Animation</h1>		<p>The animation image layer type is used to display a series of images which automatically play back in sequence.</p>
	<p>Specify the images to display in the animation with the <strong>Filenames</strong> button (see <a href="creator.images.filenames.html"> "Importing Filenames"</a>).</p>
	<p>Once you have selected your sequence of images, you can adjust the speed at which they play back with the <strong>Speed</strong> control. This is specified in seconds, so that a speed of <strong>1</strong> will result in an image change every one second.</p>
	<p>Specify the number of times to loop playback of the image sequence with the <strong>Times to play</strong> control. A setting of <strong>1</strong> will cause the images to cycle through once and then settle on the final image. A setting of <strong>2</strong> will result in two cycle-throughs before settling on the final image, and so on. Leaving this control blank will result in an infinitely repeating cycle - the images will keep cycling through for as long as the user remains on that page.</p>
	<p>The final setting for image animations is the <strong>Cross fade</strong> toggle. Set this to "ON" to make the images fade from one to the other; set it to "OFF" to make them do a clean cut from one to the next.</p>
