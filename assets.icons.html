		<div class="container">	<h1>App icons</h1>		<p>The app icon is a square iconic representation of your app. There are a number of apple guidelines on what the icon can and can't contain and a few tips on how to note get rejected for your app icon available from the Apple Developers website. The abridged version is that you cannot use copyrighted imagery that is not your own, it cannot contain anything explicit and each icon must be unique. You cannot use the same icon for multiple apps.</p>
	<p>Although App Store Newsstand has in effect rendered the icon useless for Newsstand apps, an app icon is still required for submission to Apple. You will also need this for pre iOS 5.0 firmware which at the time of writing is still in use. Another thing to consider is if Apple change how they display Newsstand products in the future, you may well be caught out if you don't take the icon seriously.</p>
	<p>To create your app icon, you will need to provide two - four images, depending on what devices you wish to support:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>iPad icon (file name: <strong>Icon-72.png</strong>) - Your standard resolution iPad icon, this will display for non-newsstand apps and on devices using a firmware version earlier than iOS 5.0. The dimensions are 72 X 72.</li>
		<li>iPad icon Retina (file name: <strong>Icon-72@2x.png</strong>) - This is the retina version of the iPad icon. This should look like the standard one, only it's twice the size at 144 X 144.</li>
		<li>iPhone icon (file name: <strong>Icon.png</strong>) - iPhones have smaller screens, so the standard icon is 57 X 57.</li>
		<li>iPhone icon Retina(file name: <strong>Icon@2x.png</strong>) - The retina version for iPhone 3Gs' onwards is 114 X 114.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>All filenames are case sensitive and must match the above exactly.</p>
	<p>iTunes App Store icons are rounded by default, the store does this for you, it is suggested you do not attempt to do this yourself. Transparency is not supported in your icon and you can optionally have the app icon shine added by apple, it's again suggested you don't add your own shine unless you are sure you have disabled the apple built in shine.</p>
	<p>The <strong>@2x</strong> files are not an opportunity to display a different icon, both standard and retina icons should be the same icon completely, only the retina version is a higher resolution.</p>
