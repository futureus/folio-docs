		<div class="container">	<h1>Local vs Streaming Movies</h1>		<p>Creator allows you to either include a movie file in the issue itself and play it locally or to stream it in from a web server of your choice. There are pros and cons with either approach. Local movies will work even if the device isn't connected to the internet and will always be responsive, but if you use local movies the issue size will be inflated as movie files tend to be large. Streamed movies will not impact issue size, but requires an internet connection in order to be played back. It is possible to mix local and streaming movies to get the best of both worlds: movies that are integral to the experience, like an advertised centre feature, or an animated cover could be local, whereas more optional, specific movies could be streamed in, like reviews of lesser products.</p>

		<h2>Add a local movie</h2>
		<img src="images/creator.movies.local-streaming.local.png" />	</div>	<p>To add a local movie, tap the <strong>cog</strong> symbol of the movie layer in the list on the left to open the movie layer inspector panel. Tap the button marked <strong>Local file...</strong> in the upper right corner to open the file selection dialog box and pick the movie file. To find the movie file you can either scroll the list up and down, or use the search field at the top of the box. Clicking on the letters in the right hand side of the box will jump directly to movie files starting with the letter you clicked on, like how for example the iPhone Music app allows you to select from the Artist list. Once you have selected a movie file you can preview the movie by clicking the Folio <strong>play</strong> button.</p>
<p>To add a streaming movie, the process is similar: start by tapping the <strong>cog</strong> symbol of the movie layer in the list on the left to open the movie layer inspector panel. Enter the URL of the movie in the <strong>Movie file/URL</strong> text field, and tap the blue <strong>Save</strong> button in the top right corner. You can now preview your streaming movie by clicking the Folio <strong>play</strong> button.</p>
	<p>If you are using the behaviour "Download all streamed movies" in your issue, you may wish to supply a different URL to download the movie from. For example, you may wish to stream an SD version, but allow the user to download an HD version. To specify a separate download URL, enter it after your streamed URL, separated by a comma.</p>
	<p>E.g. <strong>http://streammoviefrom.mp4, http://downloadmoviefrom.mp4</strong></p>
<p>YouTube movies cannot be streamed directly into a Folio movie layer, but can be introduced using a <strong>Story</strong> layer instead. See the section <a href="creator.techniques.youtube.html"> "Playing YouTube videos"</a> for more details.</p>
