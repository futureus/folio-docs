		<div class="container">	<h1>Zoom Options</h1>		<p>With an info box in the expanded (selected) state, the zoom controls become enabled for that box.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Zoom</strong> slider is used to specify how much the image should be zoomed by when the user taps on the info box. Different info boxes can use different zoom values, as well as zooms of less than 100%, giving a zoom-out effect, if required.</p>
	<p>The final control is the <strong>Zoom to</strong> slider. By default, the zoomed image will attempt to centre itself halfway between the pin and the info box. By manipulating this slider, you can move the zoom point along the line between the pin and the centre of the box. Note that if the pin / box is close to the edge of the layer, it may not be able to be displayed at the centre of the image - it will be displayed as close possible to the centre, while still respecting the layer edges.</p>
	<p>While in the expanded mode for a given info box, you can move the box and pin to a more precise location if required, as well as editing the width. You can also click and drag within the annotation layer to see more of the image - just as a user can when viewing your annotation in the expanded mode.</p>
