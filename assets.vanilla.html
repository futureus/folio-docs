	<body>
		<div class="container">	<h1>Vanilla builds</h1>		<p>The FutureFolio container apps are branded specifically to Future. We understand that this may not be ideal in the case of 3rd party projects or implementations. Thankfully you can remove the Future branding and Future specific references with ease.</p>
	<p>To remove the standard Future logos and branding, set your container to "Vanilla Build" in the submission metadata sheet that you provide to your FutureFolio account manager. This will instantly strip out Future copyright warnings and Future logos. You will then need to enter the following 3rd Party details in your metadata sheet alongside this option:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Feedback Email Address - You can use the same address as your support address, this is primarily for users to suggest improvements and/or comment on your publication.</li>
		<li>Support Email Address - Users need a point of contact for when they experience errors, bugs or crashes. This feature enables the user to attach a log that outlines internal issues of the app. This is great for debugging the user's problem.</li>
		<li>hideMoreFromUs - Future titles promote their own Newsstand titles in the "More from us" pane. If you do not want to do a similar thing, turn it off with this option (Yes/No).</li>
		<li>Company Name - There are times the container app refers to Future, by entering your company name in this field, those references will be changed to your company.</li>
		<li>T&Cs Url - Terms and conditions are required, please refer to the Future setup for more details.</li>
		<li>Privacy Policy - Another requirement.</li>
		<li>Company website - The <strong>Visit Future</strong> button (which will not be "Visit " followed by your company name) normally visits the Future PLC website, by entering your own company website here, the button will open this URL.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You can replace the following assets also with your own for further customisation of your vanilla build:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Help page - By replacing <strong>helpPage.html</strong> with your own questions and answers, you can fully customise this section.</li>
		<li>More apps list - A <strong>applist.xml</strong> file can be generated from your metadata that will customise the More Apps content. However each entry requires a affiliate/app store URL and a cover image asset that must be provided as; <strong>cov-CODE.png</strong> where "CODE" is the code you entered in the "More Apps Cover image file name" section of the metadata sheet.</li>
		<li>Header bars - There are a number of header bars you can replace (<strong>Header_bar_320.png</strong>, <strong>Header_bar_768.png</strong>, <strong>Header_bar_1024.png</strong>); The first is the iPhone header (320 X 88 pixels), the container only displays in portrait on the iPhone. The remaining two headers are portrait and landscape iPad headers (768 X 50 pixels and 1024 X 50 pixels).</li>
	</ul>
