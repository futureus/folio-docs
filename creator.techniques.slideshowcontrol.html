		<div class="container">	<h1>Controlling the Page with Slideshows, Animations and Boxes</h1>		<p>To avoid overwhelming the user with information on a single page, it's possible to show and hide layers as the user interacts with a slideshow, animation, 360, carousel or scrolling box.</p>
	
	<p>To make this technique work, you need to name your layers in a very specific way. For example, if the slideshow, animation or box is called "mypics", you need to name the layers you want to show and hide "mypics-1", "mypics-2", and so on. You should then hide all the layers that you want start as being invisible, which, in our example, would be everything after "mypics-1".</p>
	<p>As the user swipes through slideshow pages (or as the animation advances, etc), the correct layer attached to "mypics" is shown. For example, page three of the slideshow will show "mypics-3". The same is true of animations: when the third frame of the animation is shown, "mypics-3" will be shown. FutureFolio will automatically hide all the other "mypics-" objects so that only one is showing at a time.</p>
	<p>This technique is often used to show captions that relate to a specific picture in the slideshow or animation, but you can show or hide any layers this way - boxes full of information, for example. You can also show and hide multiple layers by giving them the same name, eg you can have five layers called "mypics-1".</p>
	<p>If you want to use scrolling boxes to control the page, you should layout the box so that its content scroll off the screen horizontally, choose the option "Horizontal" under "Scroll to fit contents" (not "Both"!), then make sure "Scroll in pages" is set to either "On" or "Paging dots".</p>
