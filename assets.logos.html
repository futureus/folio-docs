	<body>
		<div class="container">	<h1>Brand logos</h1>		<p>Loitered throughout the app your logo will be visible, it's important that your logo is clear, not cluttered and in keeping with the style o the app.</p>
	<p>The top bar where your brand will be located is always dark grey fading to black, so make sure your logo is bright and works with a dark background. A standard theme in FutureFolio based apps is the use of solid white icons and logos on the top bar, it's suggested that you follow this.</p>
	<p>As for your artwork files, you will need to create two - four as with the app icon:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>iPad logo (file name: <strong>logo.png</strong>) - Your main iPad logo, it needs to be 32 pixels tall, the width is variable, but please refrain from extremely long images as it may interfere with other design elements.</li>
		<li>iPad logo retina (file name: <strong>logo@2x.png</strong>) - As with all retina images, this image needs to be identical only twice the size. This image needs to be 64 pixels tall.</li>
		<li>iPhone logo (file name: <strong>logo-iPhone.png</strong>) - Like the iPad logo this file needs to be 32 pixels tall. Remember that the iPhone is a lot slimmer than an iPad, you may want to make the image somewhat thinner to fit correctly in the limited space available on the device.</li>
		<li>iPhone logo retina (file name: <strong>logo-iPhone@2x.png</strong>) - The same image as the non-retina version, this time it's 64 pixels tall.</li>
	</ul>
