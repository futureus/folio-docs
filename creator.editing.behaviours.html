		<div class="container">	<h1>Rendition Behaviours</h1>		<p>You can attach behaviours to renditions in the same was as images, except these will be run as soon as the reader has started reading the page.</p>
	<p>For most behaviours, this means the reader will have to scroll to the page and wait a split second before the rendition behaviour begins, however an exception to this is animation pre-runs: if you set a "Run animation script" rendition behaviour to have a time delay of 0, and the animation has a delay and duration of 0, that animation will be executed before the page is seen by the user. This allows you modify the page as soon as it loads.</p>
	<p>Rendition behaviours are not run again unless the page is unloaded and reloaded. For example, if the user watches an animation play, swipes to the next page, then swipes back to the animation page, the animation will not be run again; the user must swipe away several pages in order for the behaviour to be run again.</p>
