		<div class="container">	<h1>AdditionalBuildFiles</h1>		<p>If you want to force FutureFolio to include a file in your build, you can create a file called AdditionalBuildFiles in your issue directory and list the file in there. This list of files, separated by line breaks, will be copied into your finished issue zip file even if FutureFolio doesn't know what they are for.</p>
	<p>This is used in several situations:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>If you have included an image in a story using an unusual technique, such as CSS. FutureFolio will not detect these images and so will not copy them into your build.</li>
		<li>If FutureFolio has failed to detect an asset, you can force it to be added.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To make this work, create a file called <strong>AdditionalBuildFiles</strong> in your issue directory. This filename is case-sensitive. You should then specify each of your filenames on its line, like this:</p>
