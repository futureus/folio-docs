		<div class="container">	<h1>Carousel</h1>		<p>Carousels provide the most advanced way of flicking through series of pictures, and has a number of configuration options that let you control precisely how they work.</p>
	<p>In its most basic form, you can create a carousel by adding several pictures to your image and choosing the Carousel image type. You will also need to enter a size in the Max Image Size box, which will be used to size each individual image inside the carousel. This Max Image Size setting will be used to scale your images down proportionately so they are never shown larger than this size.</p>
	<p>For Carousel type you can provide one of several options:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Coverflow - images array themselves to the left and right of the main image; the reader can swipe to rotate them in 3D.</li>
		<li>Rotary - images are placed in 3D space as if they were hanging from a mobile that the reader can spin around.</li>
		<li>Inverted Rotary - the same as Rotary, except the reader is placed inside the mobile</li>
		<li>Cylinder - images are mapped into 3D space as if they were wrapped around a cylinder.</li>
		<li>Inverted Cylinder - the same as Cylinder, except the reader is placed inside the cylinder.</li>
		<li>Wheel - the images are placed flat onto the page, and spun around a central point off screen below.</li>
		<li>Inverted Wheel - the same as Wheel, but spun around a central point off screen above.</li>
		<li>Time Machine - places images into a 3D stack going off into the distance of the screen; the reader can swipe to zoom through the images.</li>
		<li>Inverted Time Machine - the same as Time Machine, but the reader swipes the other way.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The default option is Coverflow.</p>
	<p>You can customise the layout of your carousel by adding two keywords to your carousel type: "Wrap" will make the carousel infinite so that when the reader reaches the end it will loop to the beginning, and "Vertical" will rotate the carousel so that it slides vertically – for example, "Inverted Cyclinder Vertical Wrap".</p>
	<p>The Max Image Size dictates how big your images appear inside the carousel. You must specify this as "WidthxHeight", eg "500x350". This is required because your image box provides the area in which your carousel works, but the images inside must have their own size.</p>
	<p>By default, Carousels work similarly to slideshows: as they are swiped, layers named the same as the carousel with -1, -2, -3 and so on at the end will be shown and hidden as if they are captions. If you wish to disable this, enable "Activate with taps" - the user must now tap an image in the carousel to show its associated caption.</p>
