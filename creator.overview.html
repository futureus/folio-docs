		<div class="container">	<h1>Overview</h1>		<p>This section will walk you through the basics of FutureFolio Creator, explaining how the core objects of an issue hang together.</p>
	<p>The complete stack of FutureFolio objects, from very largest to very smallest, is as follows:</p>
	
	<ul>
	
		<li>One complete interactive edition of a magazine is called an <em>issue</em>, and, when it ships to readers, is provided as a single <strong>.zip</strong> file that contains all the text, graphics, movies and other media required to recreate the magazine on their devices.</li>
		<li>Each issue is made up of one or more <em>sections</em>, such as News, Reviews and Tutorials. Sections are used to split up the table of contents and can also provide navigation around the issue.</li>
		<li>Each section is made up of one or more <em>pages</em>, so the Tutorials section might have an iPhoto tutorial, a Photoshop tutorial, and a Google Chrome tutorial.</li>
		<li>Each page is made up of one or more <em>renditions</em>, which define the way the page looks on a device. For example, you might create renditions for tablets in both portrait and landscape orientations.</li>
		<li>Each rendition is made up of one or more <em>layers</em>, which are the actual items on the page – images, text, movies, and so on.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In practice, Future magazines use only one rendition: tablet portrait or tablet landscape.</p>
