		<div class="container">	<h1>360</h1>		<p>The 360 image layer type is a sequence of images which the user cycles through by swiping. A single swipe results in multiple image changes, which continue, decelerating, after the user lets go, finally coming to rest a short while later.</p>
	<p>360s are designed for image sequences such as a series of pictures of an object from different angles, all the way around. This creates the illusion of a 3D model of the object which the user pans around by swiping.</p>
	<p>Effectively, a 360 image layer gives the illusion of a user-controlled animation. While most effective as a 360-degree animation of an object, it can also be used to good effect in many other types of animation, where the images are seen as keyframes.</p>
	<p>Specify the sequence of images to display in the 360 with the <strong>Filenames</strong> button (see <a href="creator.images.filenames.html"> "Importing Filenames"</a>).</p>
	<p>The two figures below give examples of image sequences that have been used to good effect as 360 image layers.</p>
	<a name="creator.images.360.example1"></a><div class="figure">
		<h2>360 degree object style layer</h2>
		<img src="images/creator.images.360.example1.png" />	</div>	<a name="creator.images.360.example2"></a><div class="figure">
		<h2>Keyframe animation style layer</h2>
		<img src="images/creator.images.360.example2.png" />	</div>	<p>You can control the response speed of your 360 layer by setting the <strong>Swipe speed</strong> value. The default is <strong>1</strong>. To make the image changes more responsive, increase this number. To make them less responsive, decrease it.</p>
	<p>Just like with slideshows, you can associate layers with each of the component images in a 360 by naming them the same as the 360 layer name, followed by a dash and a number. As the user swipes through the image sequence, these specially named layers will be shown and hidden at the appropriate times.</p>
	<p>For example, name your 360 layer <strong>main</strong>, then create layers named <strong>main-1</strong>, <strong>main-2</strong> and so on, hiding each one except the one you start from (<strong>main-1</strong>). As you swipe through, <strong>main-1</strong> will be shown when the first image displays, <strong>main-2</strong> when the second image displays, and so on.</p>
