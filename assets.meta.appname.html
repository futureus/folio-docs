		<div class="container">	<h1>Naming your app</h1>		<p>Currently your app's name is it's number one influence on your search result ranking in the Apple iTunes App Store. Your app's name needs to match the exact word you wish to rank for if you want to maximise the effect, no extra words, just the word you want to be top for. This isn't ideal for most publications as they wish to maintain a brand image. Also it's useless to rank for something if your app would be of no interest to that audience.</p>
	<p>Apple has recently taken a strong stance against the opposite spectrum of app name ranking, "keyword stuffing", these are apps that stuff many relevant keywords into their title, they are now being rejected on a regular basis.</p>
	<p>Finally, all app names must be unique, if someone else got your app name before you then you will have to settle for an alternative name or appending <strong>"magazine"</strong> or <strong>"mag"</strong>.</p>
