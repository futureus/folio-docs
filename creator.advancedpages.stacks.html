		<div class="container">	<h1>Stacks</h1>		<p>Some publishers like to make their issues fast to navigate, there are various ways to achieve this and one is to stack pages. The advantage of stacked pages is that the user can quickly browse pages and sections by swiping horizontally and if they want to read that article they can simply swipe vertically to view it.</p>
	<p>Stacks always require a top page, the first page before the first stacked page is the top most page in that stack.</p>
	<p>To stack a page, in the Pages tab of the Issue Editor window, select the page that you want to place in a stack with the page above and tap the right arrow button that is next to the word "Stack", this will indent the layer visually representing that it is a child of the first layer above it that is not indented (page ordering in the stack works in the same way as non-stacked pages).</p>
	
	<div class="caution">
		<h2>Stacked pages, long pages and scrolling</h2>
		<p>Normally, full-screen slideshows will allow the reader to swipe to the next page when they reach the end of the slideshow, but this functionality becomes disabled when you are using long pages. This also applies to any kind of horizontal scrolling within a page, such as wide pages.</p>
		<p>Put simply, every FutureFolio issue scrolls between pages left to right. If you use stacks and/or long pages, your pages will also scroll up and down. If you also then use a wide page and/or a full-screen slideshow, the user will not be able to swipe to the next page.</p>
		<p>This is obviously bad, so you have two choices:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Turn off stacks and/or make your page a normal size. This will restore normal scrolling behaviour.</li>
			<li>Avoid using horizontal scrolling on your page, either by making your slideshow less than full screen (thus giving the user a tappable area where they <em>can</em> scroll), or by avoiding wide pages.</li>
		</ul>
