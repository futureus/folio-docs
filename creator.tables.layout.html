		<div class="container">	<h1>Sections, Columns and Rows</h1>		<p>Tables are made up of sections, columns and rows. Each section has a section header which floats above the rows of that section as the user is scrolling through the table. Once the user scrolls into a new section, the old section's header is bumped offscreen by the new section's header.</p>
	<p>Note that section headers will be hidden if no text has been entered into them.</p>
	<a name="creator.tables.layout.sections"></a><div class="figure">
		<h2>User-scroll from first to second section</h2>
		<img src="images/creator.tables.layout.sections.png" />	</div>	<p>In the table editor, click on <strong>Add Section</strong> to add a new section to your table, and <strong>Add Column</strong> to add a column. Rows are added by typing data into the blank row at the bottom of the appropriate section.</p>
	<p>Column widths are set as a percentage of the table's width. The first column added is always set to be the full width of the table (100%). As you add more columns in, you will need to adjust your columns' widths so that the total width adds up to 100%. To aid you in this, the table editor shows you each column's width in the section header for that column, as well as the total column width for each section. It will also display an error message if you click on <strong>Save Changes</strong> when the total width is not 100% in any section. Note that column widths are set per-section to allow for sections with differently-sized columns.</p>
	<p>To change a column width, tap on the section header for that column to bring up the column settings menu (<a href="#creator.tables.customising.columnrowsection"> "Column, row and section header settings menus"</a>), and enter the required width in the <strong>Width %</strong> control.</p>
	<p>To delete a section, click on the red <strong>Delete</strong> button next to the section's header. If the section contains rows, and there are more sections in the table, you will be given the option of deleting the section's rows or simply moving them to an adjacent section.</p>
	<p>To delete a row, click on the red <strong>Delete</strong> button next to the row.</p>
	<p>To delete a column, click on the column in any section's header to bring up the column settings menu (<a href="#creator.tables.customising.columnrowsection"> "Column, row and section header settings menus"</a>), and click the <strong>Delete</strong> button. The column will be deleted from each section.</p>
	<p>Rows can be rearranged by clicking and holding the <strong>drag handle</strong> icon at the end of the row and dragging it to the desired position.</p>
