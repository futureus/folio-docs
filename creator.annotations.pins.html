		<div class="container">	<h1>Adding Pins</h1>		<p>To add a pin to your annotation layer, click on the blue <strong>add</strong> button on the bottom right of the dialog. A new pin and associated info box will appear over your background image.</p>
	<p>To move the info box, click anywhere within the box and drag it around your layer. To move the pin, click on it and drag to the required anchor point.</p>
	<p>To change the width of the info box, drag the blue pin on the right side of the box.</p>
	<p>When you tap on the info box, it will animate to its "expanded" mode and perform its associated zoom operation on the background image. When the info box is selected in this way, you can edit its text and zoom operation with the controls at the bottom of the dialog. You can also delete the selected info box and pin with the red <strong>delete</strong> button.</p>
	<p>The text displayed by an info box is split into two parts - title and body. When the info box is in its unexpanded form, just the title is shown. When the user expands the info box, the title is shown followed by the body. Use the <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Body</strong> fields to edit the text for these.</p>

		<h2>Pin image</h2>
		<p>The image used for the pins can be overridden if required. To do so, simply create an image named <strong>folioIconPin.png</strong> and another named <strong>folioIconPin@2x.png</strong> and place them inside your issue directory. These files are built into your issue automatically.</p>
		<p>If you choose to override the pin image you must provide <em>both</em> the standard- and retina-sized versions. Providing just the standard image would mean that the default image is displayed on retina devices.</p>
		<p>For reference, the default pin image is 10 pixels by 10 pixels. You can make your custom image any size and it will be displayed at your size.</p>
