		<div class="container">	<h1>Videos</h1>		<p>Videos can take up a disproportionately large amount of space in your issue, and there are two ways to correct this:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Reduce the quality: although the iPad as a result of 1024x768 or 2048x1536 depending on the model, it is not necessary to have your videos at this resolution. Low-resolution pictures look soft in the screen, but movies – by their very nature – <em>move</em>, and so the lower resolution is less obvious to the eye. Our tests have shown that video resolutions as low as 512x384 look perfectly fine even on retina iPads.</li>
		<li>Stream your videos: if you have compressed your videos and they still take up too much space, consider streaming your videos from the web. These can be placed and used in Creator the same way as local movies, but they take up no space at the cost of requiring the reader to be connected to the internet.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>You can mix and match local and streaming videos. If your video is required for the page, eg a video for your cover or some other important footage, then you can include it in the issue and let others stream.</p>
