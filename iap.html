		<p>In-App Purchasing (IAP) is the mechanism by which you monetize your product. Apple takes much of the pain out of purchasing, including the handling of credit card payments, collection of tax, which is part of the service they provide for the 30% revenue cut they take. You decide how much to charge for single issues, and for subscriptions, within a tiered pricing structure that Apple provides. There are no hard and fast rules on how much you should or shouldn't charge for your product. You know your readership and your market and probably have a feel for what will and what won't be acceptable.</p>
