		<div class="container">	<h1>JPEG vs PNG</h1>		<p>The most effective way to lower your issue size is to create your images in the correct format. Nearly all images in FutureFolio Creator should be in one of two image formats:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>JPEG: best for photos; must have no transparency.</li>
		<li>PNG: best for highly important pictures, pictures of text, or any image requiring transparency.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When you run a build, Creator allows you to adjust the compression of JPEGs, but it will leave PNG images untouched.</p>
	<p>JPEG images will, in nearly all circumstances, be smaller files than PNG images, and at higher compression levels the difference could be 5x or more. As a result, we strongly recommend that you use JPEG for <em>all</em> your photographic images.</p>
	<p>JPEG compression can create some artefacting that may be unpleasant in certain kinds of images, particularly if the picture contains text. If you run a build and find the JPEG compression is unpleasant on some pictures, you should consider changing them to PNG on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p>Similarly, you may wish to use PNG for some images if they are standing graphics used several times in your issue and you want to ensure the image remains punchy.</p>
	
	<div class="caution">
		<h2>JPEG quality</h2>
		<p>When laying out your pages, you should ensure your JPEGs have as little compression applied as possible. This is because Creator will recompress all your JPEGs when you do a build, which means all your assets remain at maximum quality until the last moment.</p>
		<p>When you do a build, you will be prompted to select a JPEG quality setting. Although it is tempting to choose 100% under the rationale "we want our images to look good, right?", the reality is that such a setting is counterproductive.</p>
		<p>Because of the way JPEG works, a setting of 100% will actually create an image that has a larger file size than its original, with no improvement in quality. In fact, any quality over 85% will look almost identical, even though an image at 95% quality will be much larger than an 85% quality image.</p>
		<p>We suggest that you start your JPEG quality low – 33% is a fairly safe starting point – then build your issue and see how it looks, only increasing the quality as needed. If you find yourself using a JPEG quality above 75%, you will experience diminishing returns: file sizes will increase dramatically with little noticeable improvement in quality.</p>
