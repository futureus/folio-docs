		<div class="container">	<h1>Pre-runs</h1>		<p>Pre-run animations allow you to create an animation that runs on a page before the user has seen it, for example if you want to move things off screen or fade them out.</p>
	<p>To create a pre-run animation, go to the Rendition Settings window and add a Run Animation Script behaviour that runs your animation with delay 0. In your animation script, you must ensure that your animation has a delay 0 and duration 0.</p>
	<p>Any animation that matches these conditions will be executed as soon as the page is created, before it is shown to the user. You can perform any animations you like, and it will all be done instantly.</p>
	<p>In addition to the usual collection of animation movements you can choose from, animation pre-runs also allow you to configure the point of rotation for a layer. This defaults to the centre of the layer, meaning that it will rotate as if someone had pushed a pin through its centre. See <a href="creator.animation.anchorpoints.html"> "Anchor Points"</a> for more information.</p>
