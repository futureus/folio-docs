	<p>Here are a few messages you may find in your <strong>buildReport</strong> file and what they mean</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The following files are missing			These are files that are either added to layers, particle effects or in the body of story layers that are not actually present in the issue folder inside the <strong>EditingIssues</strong> directory</li>
		<li>The following images had a retina version provided or autogenerated which was smaller than double size. Please provide a source image which is at least double the size you wish it to be displayed at.			A manually created retina image (one ending in <strong>@2x.png</strong> or <strong>@2x.jpg</strong>) isn't exactly double the size of the original one. You will either need to create a new retina image or provide a high resolution image and let FutureFolio creator create one for you.</li>
		<li>A retina version could not be generated for the following images as the source image provided was no larger than the required display size. Please provide a source image which is at least double the size you wish it to be displayed at.			If you want the issue to support retina displays you'll need to provide a larger images for the FutureFolio Creator to create the retina files.</li>
		<li>A retina version could not be generated for the following images as the required display size is unknown. Please provide an @2x retina image as well as a standard-sized one at the size you require.			Layers like stories, tables and particle effects will not autogenerate their retina counterparts, to support retina you will have to manually create these files.</li>
		
		<li>A retina version was not generated for the following images as they are already marked as "@2x". Did you mean to specify this file rather than the standard size one?			This is just a check that you indeed have created your own retina images for these particular file names</li>
